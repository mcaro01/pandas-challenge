# Analysis 
This challenge is about a new Chief Data Scientist for my cityâ€™s school district. This analysis assisted the school board and mayor to make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
We were given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend.
As my first task, I was asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. This will aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance by using panda script.

The Analysis included:
1.	District Summary
2.	School Summary
3.	Highest & Bottom Performing Schools % Overall Passing Rate.
4.	Math & Reading Scores by Grade Level
5.	Scores by School Spending
6.	Scores by School Size
7.	Scores by School Type
Comparison between District and Charter schools
	Highest/Bottom Performing Schools 
Based on observation of the data with reference to the highest -performing schools vs Bottom performing schools, the top five were all charter schools, while the bottom five were all district schools. In fact, when comparing all fifteen schools on their overall passing rate, charter schools ranked above district ones. 
Math/Reading Score 
Charter schools had significantly higher scores and passing rates when it comes to math, it is not as simple to reach a conclusion with reading scores.
The average reading score among charter schools was only 3 points higher than that among district ones, but district schools suffer a significant drop in their student population that is passing reading.
Consultation with HOD of the reading department for the district schools will give us a thorough understanding why this occurs.


%Overall Passing 
The charter schools had the medium populations, medium budget, and the percentage of overall passing students is above the district schools. The district schools had the largest populations, largest budgets, and lowest passing rates.
Comparatively Students from charter school noticeably outperforming those from district school in both math and reading as well overall passing.
